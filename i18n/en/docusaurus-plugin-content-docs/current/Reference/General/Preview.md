# Preview

A function that temporarily applies the results of a TexTransTool component.

## Notes

- If you want to preview multiple components at the same time, you must use TexTransGroup.
- Since the original texture used by SimpleDecal, etc. is not accessed, the image quality may be low in some cases.
  - The results may differ, especially if the texture's Alpha Is Transparency is not enabled.
