# Logo Guidelines

The TexTransTool logo is intended to show users that they are able to use TexTransTool, or that advanced expressions can be achieved relatively easily using TexTransTool. It is a guideline for those who wish to use the TexTransTool logo when advertising their products to avoid confusion.

You may use the logo without prior permission provided as long as it is in accordance with these guidelines. However, the final decision on whether or not the use of the logo is appropriate rests with [ReinaSakiria](#reinasakiria) and [みーりゃ](#みーりゃ), and you may be asked to discontinue your use if it is confirmed as inappropriate.

In addition, even if your request does not comply with the guidelines, please contact us and we may be able to consider it on an individual basis. Please feel free to contact us at the [Contact details](#contact-details).

## Applicable Products

- It can be used to promote products that include textures and prefabs that can be presented as using TexTransTool (for additional textures, images for decals, avatars, costumes, etc.).
  - Only if the use of TexTransTool is in use or if the TexTransTool component is included in the prefab.
- It can also be used to promote editor extensions for avatar modification and creation that are compatible with TexTransTool (or require it as a dependency).
  - The TexTransTool logo must not be used in any UI implemented independently, such as within the editor (to make it clear which is the original TexTransTool).
- The logo must not be presented in a way that suggests that TexTransTool has approved or recommended the product.
- If the product meets the requirements, the logo can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

## Logo Placement

- Use the logo as is. Do not change or alter it.
  - However, you may add an outline or drop shadow to the logo to improve its visibility against the background.
- Do not animate the logo or use it as part of a pattern or background.
  - However, if used in a video, you may use transition animations as long as they do not make significant changes to the shape or style.
- The logo must be used in a manner that provides sufficient contrast and visibility.
- The logo must be placed at a reasonable distance from other elements to ensure clear visibility and readability.

## Logo Color

- The logo must always be in its original colors. Please note that color variations are not currently available.
